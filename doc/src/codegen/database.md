Projectile reads the details of your PostgreSQL database, and generates Scala code intended to be used alongside the @ref[Projectile libraries](../libraries/index.md).
It creates only what you ask for, from basic case classes to a full admin site with GraphQL.

If you've already @ref[installed Projectile](../gettingStarted/installing.md), started the server, and @ref[created your project](../gettingStarted/project.md),
you can edit the installed features, export your project, and end up with a pleasantly-designed Scala application.
