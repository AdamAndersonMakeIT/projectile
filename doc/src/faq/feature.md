# Enabling Features

Projectile projects can grow from a small utility to a intricate admin app. 
See the @ref[feature list](../codegen/database.md) for details on the available features for database projects. 

Adding features enables new generated code. To do so, either run `projectile feature-set` (which will show detailed instructions), or click "Edit Features" in the project's page.
