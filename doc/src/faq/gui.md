# Accessing the GUI

## Installing

First, install Projectile using one of the methods described in @ref[Installing Projectile](../gettingStarted/installing.md).
Note that the SBT plugin can't provide the GUI, so one of the other methods (usually homebrew) is required.

## Run the GUI
From your project's directory, run `projectile server`. That's it.
