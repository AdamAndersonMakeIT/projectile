The Planning Poker tutorial will start with a small Scala application, add Projectile, and export more and more features, finally producing a web application with:

- Websocket transport of shared Scala classes for real-time client updates
- Play Framework admin site with UI for data access, search, and mutations
- Full GraphQL API, with a schema visualizer and query IDE 
- Code generated services to reduce CRUD boilerplate
