# Sandbox Tasks

@@@ note { .tip title="This is an admin feature" }

It depends on a project that extends `projectile-lib-admin` or enables the `ProjectilePlayProject` plugin

To enable this feature, add `->  /admin/sandbox  projectileSandbox.routes` to your `routes` file

Mostly a developer tool, this is a framework to run ad-hoc tasks and explore the results
